## EXPERIENCE

**Intel Corporation** | Cloud Software Development Engineer | *April 2022 – July 2025*

* **Platform & Foundational Services:** Building foundational platform services including **system telemetry and observability**, **Identity and Access Control (IAM)**, product installer, and internal developer environments for **Edge Manageability Framework (EMF)**.
* **Cloud & DevOps Orchestration:** Utilized **Golang** for package delivery services and managed scalable cloud resources on **AWS** (EKS, RDS, S3, Lambda). Orchestrated **Kubernetes** cluster lifecycle and established robust **GitOps workflows** (ArgoCD) using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
* **AI Agent Development:** Architected a **GenAI Service Management Agent** to automate the provisioning and diagnostics of internal development environments. Implemented **ReAct prompting** and **custom LLM tool calls** (LangChain/LlamaIndex), **reducing Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) security vulnerabilities from *2 hour* to *10 minutes*** by automating checks for outdated kernel/packages.
* **LLM & RAG Implementation:** Engineered **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines and deployed optimized **local LLM models**. The agent’s combined capabilities **identified 50% in potential monthly cost savings** by tracking and surfacing underutilized developer VMs and resource usage.

**Open Networking Foundation (ONF)** | Member of Technical Staff | *July 2018 – April 2022*

* **Stratum OS Development:** Co-developed **Stratum**, an open-source switch operating system, in collaboration with **Google** and **Intel**. Implemented **gNMI** and **P4Runtime** protocols to enable software-defined management of white-box switches.
* **SD-Fabric Architecture:** Built the control plane for **SD-Fabric**, a programmable network fabric for edge applications. Utilized **Kubernetes** for orchestration and **Golang** for high-performance microservices.
* **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Managed production-grade CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure using **Terraform**, **Jenkins**, and **GitHub Actions**, significantly reducing deployment times for the distributed engineering team.

**Open Networking Foundation (ONF)** | Engineering Intern (USA) | *January 2017 – February 2018*

* **SDN Controller Development:** Contributed to the **ONOS** (Open Network Operating System) controller and **M-CORD** (Mobile Central Office Re-architected as a Datacenter) project.
* **Industry Collaboration:** Collaborated directly with engineers from **Google** and **Intel** to implement next-generation programmable data plane solutions (P4).
* **Impact:** Work contributed to the **Google Tor.p4 demo** showcased at SDN NFV World Congress, demonstrating P4Runtime integration on commercial hardware.

**Cyber Link** | QA Intern | *July 2010 – August 2010*

* Developed automatic testing tools using **Autoit** to find bugs and expedite the Quality Assurance process.
